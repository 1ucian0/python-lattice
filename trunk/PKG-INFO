Description: 
    A finite lattice is an algebraic structure in which any two elements have a
    unique supremum and an infimum. More info at the wikipedia page. There is 
    no limitation in the element class (supports unhashable types) and a Hasse 
    diagram can be created. Comments of any kind are welcome. More info at
    https://code.google.com/p/python-lattice/ or in the README file.
